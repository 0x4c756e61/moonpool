# welcome to Lyna's moonpool <3
My very own extension repository for my [moonlight](https://moonlight-mod.github.io/) plugins !


### emojiRenderer
Transforms emojis from FakeNitro and freemoji into real discord emojis !

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently the freemoji plugin appends emoji urls to your messages rather than replacing current the emoji with links (`[name](url)`). As such they are not currently supported. See pull request [pull/3](https://github.com/uwx/moonlight-extensions/pull/3)
